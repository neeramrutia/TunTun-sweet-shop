## 🤖 My AI Usage

During this project, I made use of AI tools to improve productivity and problem-solving.

**AI Tools Used:**
- ChatGPT (OpenAI)  

**How I Used Them:**
- I used **ChatGPT** to clarify deployment issues (Vercel + Render setup), generate boilerplate README content, and debug TypeScript errors.  
- I also created api and mongoDB models with help of AI 

**Reflection on AI’s Impact:**  
AI significantly sped up my workflow by reducing time spent on boilerplate and configuration.  

- It helped me stay focused on core logic rather than syntax details.  
- Sometimes GPT suggestions were incorrect, so I had to critically evaluate and refine them.  
- Overall, AI tools acted like a coding assistant — not replacing my work, but accelerating it and reducing errors.
